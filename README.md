# walking_dead_database

This is my project for the C# session of Code Louisville. My project is a Walking Dead Database.  It is a CRUD application that has every single episode saved to a database. It also gives you the ability to add episodes as future seasons happen.  As someone who hasnt wached the show, it gives me the opportunity to watch each episode at my own pace. I can open the app to read the plot to remind myself where the story is at.  It also allows me to leave a review of each episode so I can keep track of favorites and remember reactions to each episode.  The best part of the app is that it lets you mark each episode as "complete" when you are finished watching it, so that you know which episode you are on.  To make it easier to track where you are at, I have added a counter to the top of the app that counts how many episodes you have "Completed".  There is no special way to run the app, just open it click the links on the right if you need to edit, or delete an episode.  The link at the top left allows you to creat a new episode as new ones come.  Pre-loaded to the database is the first 7 season adding up to over 80 episodes.
